## Number Guessing Game

This folder contains a program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it.

## How to Run

```bash
python number_guess.py
```
## Description

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.

The user inputs guesses, and the program provides feedback: too high, too low, or correct.
Counts the number of attempts and displays it once the user guesses correctly.

## Example
```
Guess the number between 1 and 100!
Enter your guess: 50
Too low. Try again!
Enter your guess: 75
Too high. Try again!
Enter your guess: 63
🎉 Correct! You guessed it in 3 attempts!
